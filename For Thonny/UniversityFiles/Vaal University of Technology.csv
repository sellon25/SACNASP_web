The function of a Medical Laboratory Scientist
Qualified medical laboratory scientists are specialized health professionals who play an integral role in the healthcare of society by 
providing vital information about a patient’s state of health. Their input is necessary 
in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of diseases. They diagnose 
chemical, blood, immunologic, tissue, cellular disorders and also the presence of microorganisms that cause diseases. 
They analyze human specimens such as blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), peritoneal fluid, 
pericardial fluid, and synovial fluid, and more other specimens."

data in the field and conduct tests in the lab. For example, they will test 
water, soil, or air samples to verify pollution and its source. 
The environmental scientist will then undertake a rigorous assessment 
to identify if that contaminant source has the potential to affect or harm 
individuals and communities. Further, they will present their findings 
to other scientist and key stakeholders, including government officials, 
then advance possible ways to solve the problem. They also advise on 
guidelines of mitigating the problem, and also are involved in crafting 
future policies"
