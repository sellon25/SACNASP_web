The curriculum is structured across five learning areas: foundational science, forestry production science, forest economics and entrepreneurship, natural resource management, and forest extension (with an emphasis on innovation). Each of these provides grounding in areas critical to sustainable forest production within a forestry systems framework. Hence, it focuses on such key areas as Forest Biometrics and Remote Sensing; Forest Soils; Forest Biology; Silviculture; Forestry Ecology and Conservation, Wood Science and Forest Economics/Entrepreneurship and Management. The programme also includes the development of broader competencies such as leadership, writing and communication, the use of technology innovation as part of their learning tools, problem solving, honesty and integrity. It will contribute towards increasing the qualification and skill-base of graduates from which lecturers, trainers, researchers and other forestry related professionals can be selected."
