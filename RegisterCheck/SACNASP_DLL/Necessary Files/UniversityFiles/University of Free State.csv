and continuous assessment.
The purpose of this programme is to educate students who may register in the appropriate category for which they qualify
with the South African Council for the Architectural Profession in terms of the provisions of the Architectural Profession Act
44 of 2000. The degree BArch provides access to the BArchHons degree.
Students are strongly advised to work in an architect’s office or other approved similar institution during holidays in order to
gain practical experience.
The assessments and examinations for the degree BArch are recognised by the minister concerned in terms of the
provisions of the Architectural Profession Act (Act 44 of 2000). Training experience after completion of the BArch degree
will be controlled by the conditions of the South African Council for the Architectural Profession. The registrar of this Council
will provide information in this regard."

The BAgric qualification will allow persons to apply their knowledge in the fields of resource utilisation, agricultural production, processing, management and communication.
Learning programmes in this Field of study offer seven options. These learning programmes will lead to one of the following qualifications: BAgric, Agricultural Extension, Agricultural
Management, Animal Production, Crop Production with specialisation in either field crops or horticulture, Irrigation Management, and. The table below indicates the combinations for the
different qualifications. Each student includes all the compulsory modules (row C1, C2 and C3) from the prescribed disciplines for all three study years. Students must select sufficient
other modules from their own electives (E) to obtain a total of at least 120 credits for each of the first, the second and the third year of study. Two modules at any NQF level can be
replaced by any approved modules in the CESM categories for the SAQA approved qualification. This modules must have the same NQF-level as well as enough credits to meet the
minimum credits for the degree."

adding wildlife dynamics to the ecosystem will contribute towards conservation and sustainability. This science based course has a strong conservation focus with a broad background in natural resources, the
environment, wildlife, zoology, genetics and botany to prepare a student for post-graduate studies and management careers. Knowing that Rangelands represent approximately almost 50% of the earth’s land
area and are the main provider to the multiple ecosystem services for wildlife, this is a suitable course where we will expand and diversify knowledge on ecological systems in our unique and diverse country.
Rangeland and wildlife ecologists could end up as environmental consultants, environmental planners and analysts, educators or an academic, program scientists and managers, wildlife biologists and field
ecologists where the knowledge can effectively be used in everyday practices being a biologist who not just understand, but also continue to study animals in their natural habitat and evaluate the effects of
human impact on their environment."

solutions to sustainability in the field of agriculture. Sustainability in terms of food security, national resources and energy are key factors that inform the national and global development
agenda. Sustainable agriculture seeks to sustain farms, resources and communities by promoting farming practices and methods that are profitable, environmentally sound and to the
benefit of communities.
The Master’s Degree in Sustainable Agriculture contains 180 credits and is presented in a minimum period of one year. This degree will develop agricultural specialists that could support
sustainable agricultural practice, and in return support food security and socio-economic development.
The programme consists of five compulsory modules and submission of a research component in the form of a mini-dissertation. The programme requires assignments to be completed
by students and submitted at predetermined dates. Assignments will be marked and graded by the lecturers, who will give students feedback in a written and oral format during contact
sessions. Assignments will be part of a continual assessment process. The mini-dissertation, script or publishable manuscript or published article is conducted and examined under the
supervision of a supervisor or supervision committee. External assessment is done by a separate appointed panel of experts."

• Mining has traditionally consisted of various disciplines, which have been managed, in a fragmented fashion. The results of fragmented management led to task duplication and noncoordination of activities that span the whole spectrum of mining functions. These actions invariably resulted in the development of a high cost structure.
• The main objective of the Master in Mineral Resource Management is to effectively integrate the relevant fields of expertise so as to manage mining activities in the most cost effective manner possible.
• The programme will consist of four separate parts taken over a period of at least two years. In phase one, students will be exposed to basic Geology, Mining, Metallurgy and Business Principles as an
introduction before being exposed to more detail in the applied modules. Phase two and three modules will contain more detail and will also address other deficiencies of the students.
• Upon the successful completion of the compulsory modules in Phase 1 and GLGD7913/7923 from Phase 2, four modules from Phase 2 and two modules from Phase 3 (a total of 12 modules) and

The Postgraduate Diploma would serve as a feeder programme for the MSc majoring in Integrated Water Management with the provision that the students entering must also have the necessary scientific
undergraduate backing in the form of a Bachelor of Science or relevant, equivalent qualification. Furthermore, we have also received several external enquiries from candidates from all levels of government,
