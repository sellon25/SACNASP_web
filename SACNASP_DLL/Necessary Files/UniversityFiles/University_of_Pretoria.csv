null;null;null;null;Academic orientation 107;UPO 107;null;"Part 1: Introduction to industrial and organisational psychology
This module is an introduction to the history, background and subfields of Psychology with specific emphasis on
Industrial and Organisational Psychology. The various schools of thought in psychology and its fields of
application are discussed within a meta-theoretical context. The basic principles of how psychological
knowledge, research and other methods are used to understand and handle human problems in their
environments is addressed. The module ends with the biological basis of behaviour which is addressed in order
to lay the foundation for part 2 – individual processes.
Part 2: Individual processes
This module is concerned with the individual processes that provide input into the work situation. The purpose of
this module is to increase one’s understanding of individuals and their contribution to society. Sensation and
perception, which follows from the biological basis of behaviour, has a look at the senses of the individual and
his perception in the work environment, considering aspects such as shape, depth, distance and colour
perceptions. Learning and cognition is then discussed as behavioural processes that are integrated into work
behaviour. We close off the module with a discussion on the continuous development of human beings across
theirs lifespan within the different domains of life."

behaviour and utility maximisation, production and the costs thereof, and the different market models and firm
behaviour. Labour market institutions and issues, wage determination, as well as income inequality and poverty
