University of cape town ;Science;ARCHAEOLOGY;1;THE HUMAN PLANET: PREHISTORY TO PRESENT;AGE1002S;18;"This aim of this course is to introduce the study of archaeology, and the study of human origins. 
Archaeology is defined as the study of the human past through material culture. Over the second 
semester, this course presents an overview of prehistory leading up to the modern day, as well as the 
broader climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and cultural contexts which made modern humans. 
In particular, it looks at the past through the lens of what people leave behind - the archaeological 
record. 
What you can expect to take away from this course: 
•A broad understanding of the timescales of human prehistory, and our interactions with the Earth 
System, from the Early Pleistocene through to the Historical period, and the emergence of present day 
societies (the ""Anthropocene""). 
•An understanding of current concepts in archaeological thought, and the complexities of relationships 
between archaeologists, science, and society today. 
•Familiarity with the foundational skills and terminology necessary for present-day archaeological 
research and investigation. 
This broad course is suitable for all undergraduate students in the sciences and humanities; but 
particularly for those wishing to major in Archaeology, Environmental & Geographical Science, or 
cognate subjects."
null;null;null;1;TOWARDS A DECOLONISED SCIENCE IN SOUTH AFRICA;AGE1005L;18;"This course addresses some key topics relevant to the decolonization of science in South Africa. 
Course objectives are as follows: (1) to contrast the science behind human diversity (e.g. skin colour 
variation, sex) with socially-constructed categories (e.g. race, gender binary); (2) to demonstrate how 
the history of racism and gender bias has limited the focus of scientific enquiry; (3) to highlight the 
importance of diversity and diverse voices in the production of scientific knowledge, (4) to show how 
African voices in particular have shaped and are continuing to shape the trajectory of science. The 
approach is a blended learning environment which combines online lectures, tutorials, tasks, and 
assessments. Guests both within UCT and from further afield will be brought in to supplement material 
through lectures, interviews and/or short case studies. 
Assessment: Class participation (workshops/tutorials and online discussions) 20%, online tests 20%, 
final exam 30%, final project 30%. NOTE: The allocation of 30% to the final exam breaks with the 
traditional 50% threshold. Given the format and intense interactive nature of the courses, the decision 
has been made that a large component of student assessment should be a course project which allows"
null;null;null;2;HUMAN EVOLUTION;AGE2011S;24;"Course outline: 
In AGE2011S we examine the record of primate and human evolution, showing how fossil skeletons 
and artefacts are interpreted in terms of human behaviour and evolutionary processes. We also 
consider genetic and other comparative evidence that are increasingly providing insight into the origin 
of our lineage. We answer questions such as: Why did our ancestors evolve in Africa? How did we 
evolve such large and complex brains? What advantage does bipedalism provide? When do humans 
begin to make tools? Why is human skin colour so variable? What makes humans unique? The 
syllabus for AGE2011S includes practical sessions for the study of primate and human, fossil and 
recent skeletal material and the artefacts associated with our ancestors. "
null;null;null;2;THE FIRST PEOPLE;AGE2012F;24;"All humans living today have a common African origin. The first humans were hunter-gatherers, as 
were their descendants. Indeed, our ancestors were hunter-gatherers for at least 99% of our 
evolutionary history, which means that our physical, psychological and social selves have been shaped 
by this way of life. We learn about the origin and evolution of our hunter-gatherer ancestors from 
genetic, fossil, archaeological and ethnographic evidence. Studies of Khoesan peoples of southern 
Africa have contributed significantly to our understanding of such societies. In this course we focus 
on the hunter-gatherer way of life over the past few hundreds of thousands of years. Specific topics 
covered include modern human origins, the Middle and Later Stone Age, ethnographic studies of 
Khoesan, the origins of pastoralism, coastal vs. arid environment adaptations, rock art and symbolic 
interpretation, genetics and biology, revisionism, and contemporary socio-politics and identity. In the 
weekly practical sessions, students will conduct hands-on, problem-solving exercises with 
archaeological materials. "
null;null;null;3;DIRECTED READING & RESEARCH ;AGE3006H;36;"In this course we explore the history of Africa’s people over the past 2000 years with special reference 
to southern Africa. Why are southern African populations so diverse? What lies behind the linguistic 
map that we see today? What social, technological and palaeoenvironmental systems shaped the 
evolution of societies? Did Africa have any civilisations? Who did Africa interact with? We discuss 
the archaeological record of artefacts, settlement systems, food waste, environmental contexts and 
human skeletons. We deploy historical, material science, molecular science, anthropological and 
palaeoclimatic techniques to explore this rich and diverse heritage of the last two thousand years. "

null;null;null;3;GLOBAL DIASPORAS & THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE;AGE3012S ;36;"Over the last thousand years, southern Africa has been connected to the world in a number of ways. 
From the 16th century the European push to open trade routes to the east increasingly disrupted earlier 
interactions between the southern African interior and the wider Indian Ocean region that had been in 
place from the 1st millennium AD. The European diaspora into southern Africa created new orders of 
power, control and trade that had massive impacts on indigenous societies who were subjected to 
slavery, genocide and eventually apartheid. In this course we look at these interactions and 
transformations from both foreign and local viewpoints, in which the idea of frontier is a central theme. 
The focus is on archaeological evidence and the contribution it makes to understanding the texture of 
life on frontiers and the new identities that frontiers created. In doing this the relationship between 
archaeological evidence, written sources and oral history is critically addressed, particularly in the 
search for perspectives that address cultural change and continuity at the local scale. "
null;null;null;3;ARCHAEOLOGY IN PRACTICE;AGE3013H;36;"The course will run throughout the academic year. The lecture programme (campus and field) will be 
flexible and a schedule will be decided upon in consultation with participating students. The 
curriculum covers training in site location, excavation, field note taking, stratigraphic observation, site 
survey, use of GPS and total station, photography, rock art recording, processing of field observations, 
spread sheet use, preliminary conservation and accessioning of materials, preliminary analyses and 
report writing. "

null;null;DEPARTMENT OF ASTRONOMY;1;INTRODUCTION TO ASTRONOMY ;AST1000S;18;"The course introduces students to the subject of Astronomy and our place in the universe from the 
small scales of the Earth-Sun-Moon system to the large scales of distant galaxies. It aims to provide 
insight into how we study astrophysical objects via EM radiation and telescopes (theory) as well as 
providing a high-level overview of objects in the universe, moving outwards from our solar system, 
to stars and stellar remnants, our galaxy and others, dark matter and cosmology, and the study of the 
universe at the largest scales. The course is open to all interested students as well as providing a solid 
introduction to those wishing to continue in astrophysics"
null;null;null;2;ASTROPHYSICS ;AST2002H;24;"This course presents an introduction to the theoretical aspects of modern astrophysics. The key 
objective is to illustrate the application of physical laws in an astronomical context and to explain how 
we know what we do about the universe and its constituents. Subject matter broached includes: 
Celestial mechanics; radiation laws; blackbody radiation, Planck function and approximations; 
magnitudes; the hydrogen atom; stellar spectroscopy; stellar evolution and remnants; special"
null;null;null;2;ASTRONOMICAL TECHNIQUES ;AST2003H ;24;"This course combines a large practical component (radio and optical astronomy practicals) with 
theoretical background in astronomical techniques, instrumentation and data analysis. The techniques, 
instrumentation and data analysis section includes: Positional astronomy: time systems, spherical 
astronomy, co-ordinate systems and conversions, astrometry; Detection systems: interaction of 
radiation and matter, ultraviolet and optical detectors; Optics and telescope design; Multi-wavelength 
astronomy: infrared, ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma–ray astronomy, fundamentals of radio astronomy; 
Observational techniques: photometry and spectroscopy; Orthodox statistics: probability 
distributions, Chi-squared distribution, propagation of errors; Stochastic processes and noise: photon 
noise. "
null;null;null;3;STELLAR ASTROPHYSICS;AST3002F;36;"This course introduces fundamental concepts such as radiative transfer and opacity to explain the 
observed spectroscopic and photometric signatures of stars. Students will interpret the observed 
intrinsic properties of stars through a theoretical understanding of the energy production inside stars 
and the propagation of the electromagnetic radiation from the stellar core through its interior to the 
stellar surface, from where the radiation escapes unhindered. The life cycle of stars is considered in 
great detail, from the collapse of an interstellar gas cloud to the end products of stellar evolution: white 
dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. This course includes an observational component in which the 
students use the modern teaching observatory on campus to derive fundamental properties of stars and 
stellar systems."
null;null;null;3;GALACTIC & EXTRAGALACTIC ASTROPHYSICS;AST3003S;36;"The aim of this course is to provide a broad introduction to galactic & extragalactic astrophysics and 
cosmology. Topics will include the Milky Way and normal galaxies, supermassive black holes, active 
galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and cosmology and the origin of structure in the universe. Current hot 
topics in the area are also discussed in lectures from time to time and students are encouraged to keep 
abreast of the latest developments. A further aim is to develop observing data reduction skills. Students 
will therefore participate in a fieldtrip to the South African Astronomical Observatory in Sutherland, 
where they will obtain their own spectroscopic data and will be taught how to do the data reduction 
and analysis. "

null;null;DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES;1;CELL BIOLOGY;BIO1000F;18;"Basic biological principles and processes at a cellular level provide an essential grounding for future 
study in the life sciences. The structure and function of cell components is introduced, followed by an 
introduction to chemistry, including the structure and functions of biological macro-molecules. Cell 
division and the role of genetics in inheritance and the control of biological systems is then considered. 
This leads into an introduction to membrane physiology, metabolism and its regulation. Cellular 
processes that are considered in detail include the functioning of photosynthesis and cellular 
respiration, and how these relate to organismal physiology. Cellular communication and the immune 
system of animals complete the organismal physiology. "
null;null;null;1;BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY;BIO1004S;18;"This course aims to illustrate the diversity and complexity of living organisms, from viruses to 
humans. Topics include: evolution as a means of interpreting change with time; modern theories on 
the mechanisms of evolution; the origin of species, including humans; structure and functioning of the 
simplest microbial life forms; structure and life cycles of fungi; the evolution of aquatic and terrestrial 
plants; the diversity and adaptations of invertebrate animals; the development and adaptations of 
chordate groups; primate diversity and evolution; conservation and biodiversity issues in relation to 
South African biomes and global change. The course includes a strong practical component which 
further examines biodiversity and related concepts. "
null;null;null;2;PRINCIPLES OF ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION;BIO2014F;24;"This course begins with an exploration of the mechanisms by which populations evolve and ultimately 
give rise to the entities that we term species. Building on this, it then explores the nature of the 
genealogical relationships between species (phylogeny), and the manner in which these are estimated 
in practice. The focus then shifts to abiotic and biotic controls on the distribution of species and higher 
taxa in nature, as viewed through the lens of niche theory, as well as constraints on the adaptability of 
populations or species to changing selective conditions. Finally, the course explores life history 
variation amongst organisms, including the factors that regulate its evolution and its demographic 
consequences. The latter provides context for a brief introduction to population ecology. Lectures 
provide theoretical background, while practicals and the compulsory field trip provide hands-on 
experience of material taught in lectures, as well as training in basic research techniques. "
null;null;null;2;VERTEBRATE DIVERSITY & FUNCTIONAL BIOLOGY ;BIO2015F ;24;"This course begins with an overview of the evolution, characteristics, diversity, morphology, and life 
histories of the different craniate classes, paying particular attention to adaptations underlying the 
success of the vertebrates. Distinctive or advanced biological features of each group are highlighted, 
and their ecological/economic importance briefly considered. The rest of the course comprises 
integrative, cross-taxonomic modules on the functional biology of vertebrates, notably locomotion, 
sensory systems, metabolism, homeostasis and behaviour. The course includes a strong practical 
component to demonstrate the links between form and function; as well as a compulsory 4-day field 
camp during which students will be trained in methods for studying the diversity, ecology and 
behaviour of selected vertebrate groups. "
null;null;null;2;INVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY & FUNCTIONAL BIOLOGY;BIO2016S;25;"The course exposes students to the diversity of invertebrates and their functional biologies. Topics 
will be presented within an evolutionary framework to emphasise past and contemporary selective 
pressures driving diversification. Students will be exposed to key topics in functional biology across 
the major invertebrate groups and will include cellular to organism level processes. The course begins 
with an introduction to the evolution of the invertebrates and the major phyla. This leads to an 
exploration of invertebrate functional biology, with an emphasis on key adaptations across the 
aquatic–terrestrial gradient. Lectures, practicals and field trips will expose students to contemporary 
philosophical, methodological and conceptual approaches used in the field of invertebrate functional 
biology and diversity. "
null;null;null;2;PLANT DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONAL BIOLOGY;BIO2017S;24;"The course begins with a discussion on the nature and origin of plants that includes an overview of 
major autotrophic eukaryote lineages. The benefits and challenges of life in water and on land are also 
presented. Diversity and evolution of life histories and reproductive systems in plants and 
consequences of the diversity of major plant lineages are studied. The functional biology of the major 
organs of the plant including roots, stems and leaves in relation to strategies for resource acquisition 
and utilisation, mineral nutrition, plant water relations and carbon metabolism are considered. This 
entails studying variations in root, stem and leaf morphologies in various plant lineages and unique 
terrestrial and aquatic environments and their function in water, nutrients, and carbon metabolism. 
There is a strong focus on African plants, and a particular emphasis on the Cape Floristic region. The 
course practicals are compulsory and complements the theory with hands-on experience on working 
with different lineages of plants, data collection and analysis from scientific studies and experiments, 
and scientific writing. A compulsory 4-day field camp is undertaken for students to study the 
relationship between ecology and plant morphology, function, and diversity."
null;null;null;3; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS;BIO3002F;36;"The course aims to develop and promote skills in the marine sciences in South Africa, making students 
familiar with global marine ecosystem structure and functioning, but with an emphasis on South 
African systems. Lectures, tutorials, and practicals will be aimed at developing interpretative and 
integrative skills built during previous courses (e.g., SEA2004F; BIO2014F; BIO1004S; BIO1000F), 
which cover large amounts of more basic information. A further important aim will be to develop 
numerical and written skills, as well as introducing students to modern research techniques and 
approaches. "
null;null;null;3; GLOBAL CHANGE ECOLOGY;BIO3013F;36;"How are organisms and ecosystems affected by the drivers of global environmental change? In this 
course we briefly explore the drivers of global change, both natural (e.g. Milankovitch cycles, tectonic 
drift) and anthropogenic (e.g. greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, land-use change), and then 
examine how these drivers influence (and are influenced by) terrestrial and marine biological systems. 
We cover a variety of topics, ranging from organismal and physiological responses to global change, 
biodiversity, global biogeochemical cycles, ecological function and ecosystem services. While the 
majority of the class is focussed on contemporary global change, this is contextualized relative to 
palaeohistorical environmental change. The course provides an integrated knowledge of contemporary 
environmental issues related to global change (e.g. carbon sequestration, climate change mitigation, "
null;null;null;3;CONSERVATION: GENES, POPULATION & BIODIVERSITY;BIO3014S;36;"This course introduces students to the science and practice of conservation biology, beginning with 
an overview of conservation issues, the value of biodiversity, extinction risks and the history and 
philosophy of conservation. The conservation of biodiversity is explored at multiple levels, including 
the diversity of genes, species, populations and ecosystems. At the species and population levels, we 
consider the role of life history and behaviour in the management of populations in the real world. 
The conservation and management of ecosystems is considered in terms of important processes, such 
as disturbance, re-wilding and threats by alien species. This course includes consideration of 
conservation, society, landscapes and ecosystem services. Issues to be considered here include 
incentives, access, who benefits from conservation, legal aspects and management policies."
null;null;null;3;MARINE RESOURCES;BIO3017S;36;"This course covers the science that supports renewable marine resource management. Topics include 
the diversity and life-history strategies of living marine resources, the diversity of fish and fisheries, 
surplus production, ecological responses to exploitation, monitoring and assessment techniques, 
regulatory strategies, resource economics, diversity and principles of marine aquaculture, and marine 
conservation"
null;null;null;3;ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION;BIO3018F;36;"Ecological and evolutionary processes together determine patterns of biodiversity. This Africancentric ecology and evolution course utilises regional examples within the global context to illustrate 
plant and animal ecology and evolution. The course starts with community assembly and the 
mechanisms (e.g., functional traits) that contribute to species coexistence (e.g., niche construction) 
and turnover (competition/facilitation for resources) between communities and the results of this (e.g., 
succession and alternate states). The role of disturbance (e.g., fire, herbivory, predation) in structuring 
communities and the roles of adaptation versus exaptation are then considered. Alien invasions are 
considered in the context of the supposed “empty niche” and as current examples of dispersalism and 
mechanisms (e.g., traits) of coexistence and competition. This is followed by behavioural ecology, 
focusing on how competition and cooperation between and within species affects evolutionary fitness. 
This leads into analytical biogeography, considering the distribution of species and how this was 
established (i.e., vicariance versus dispersalism) before discussing the evolution and coexistence of 
species regionally and globally. The course is based on a two-week fieldtrip before the semester starts, 
with assignment hand-ins and tutorials during the semester. "
null;null;null;3;QUANTITATIVE BIOLOGY;BIO3019S;36;"In an era of ""big data"", the ability to work with large amounts of numerical data is an important skill. Biological systems are notoriously complex across all levels of organisation and are often difficult to manipulate experimentally on meaningful temporal and spatial scales. Mathematical models provide a means of gaining insight into such systems, allowing us to disentangle complicated processes, focus on variables of interest to a particular research question, test alternative hypotheses, make predictions, and help present ideas in an unambiguous fashion. This course deals with the use, interpretation, and limits of modelling approaches in biology. In a series of modules exploring processes ranging from the behaviour of genes to understanding global scale distributions of species and communities, students will gain experience in question formulation, model development and parameterisation, interpretation of results, and model critique."

null;null;null;1;"GEOSYSTEMS: AN INTRODUCTION TO EARTH & 
ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES";GEO1009F;18;"This course aims to develop a broad understanding of how the Earth works. Over its >4.5 billion-yearlong history, the Earth has been shaped by chemical, physical and biological processes. The course 
shows why decoding the rock record of deep-time events is critical for explaining past, present and 
future environmental changes and the distribution of natural resources. The Earth has also sustained 
life in the last >3.5 billion years. Our species, Homo sapiens, is a relatively recent arrival, yet it had 
the greatest impact on our planet. The course reviews human evolution and how we became the 
dominant cause of environmental change on our planet. The course also introduces environmental 
science and examines contemporary linkages between climate, hydrology and critical surface zone 
processes within the context of human impact. Together they control the state of the environment and 
determine the resilience, vulnerability and risks for life on Earth. "

students with the main intellectual and practical skills required in the use of inferential statistics and 
statistical modelling. The course consists of 4 modules: The simulation module introduces students to 
the use of computer simulation and data re-sampling techniques (bootstrap) to investigate the 
following problems: one and two sample tests of means and variances; one and two way analysis of 
variances; moments and other properties of distributions; theory of distributions derived from normal 
distribution. The Bayesian module introduces students to decision theory and Bayesian inference. The 
generalized linear models module introduces students to the exponential family of distributions and 
extends linear and logistic regression models to models for other non-normal response variables. The 
machine learning module cover a basic introduction to statistical learning paradigms, applications of 
regression and classification trees, and a primer on feedforward neural networks and backpropagation. 
Students will use the R programming language."

";STA3036S;36;"This course forms part of the third-year major in Applied Statistics. It is an introduction to the study 
of Operational Research (OR) and explores fundamental quantitative techniques in the OR 
armamentarium with a strong focus on computer-based application. The course is intended for 
students in the applied statistics stream but may be taken as an elective by students in the mathematical 
statistics stream. Topics covered include linear and non-linear programming where students will learn 
to find optimal solutions by characterising problems in terms of objectives, decision variables and 
constraints, Decision making under uncertainty through decision trees, decision rules and scenario 
planning, Queueing Theory simulation through modelling the operation of real world systems as they 
evolve over time. "
null;null;null;3;STOCHASTIC PROCESSES & TIME SERIES;STA3041F;36;"This course forms part of the third-year major in Mathematical Statistics. It consists of two modules 
namely Stochastic Processes and Time Series Analysis. The Stochastic Processes module is aimed at 
providing introductory theory and basic applications of stochastic processes in financial modelling 
whilst the Time Series module introduces students to the foundations of the Box-Jenkins methodology 
with the intention of applying the methodology using statistical software. Details of the module 
content are as follows: 
Stochastic processes: The module covers the general theory underlying stochastic processes and their 
classifications, definitions and applications of discrete Markov chains. Branching processes are 
examined with an emphasis on analysing probability of extinction/survival. The module also covers 
both discrete and continuous time counting processes for purposes constructing forecasts and 
backcasts. Finally, a detailed introduction to homogeneous and non-homogeneous Poisson processes 
is given. 
Time series analysis: The module covers various topics including global and local models of 
dependence, stationary ARMA processes, unit root processes as well as a brief introduction to 
univariate Volatility models as well as cointegration. "

null;null;null;3;ADVANCED STOCHASTIC PROCESSES & DISTRIBUTION;STA3045F;36;"This course is a third-year module for students studying Actuarial Science or Mathematical Statistics, 
though not a requirement for a major in Mathematical Statistics. The course begins by giving a brief 
introduction to copulas and extreme value theory, together with some applications to risk 
management. The rest of the course gives a theoretical overview of stochastic processes, with the 
models covered spanning both discrete and continuous time as well as discrete and continuous statespace. Though the emphasis is on the theoretical properties of the models, the application of the 
methods to real-world problems is also explored at length. Topics covered: copulas, an introduction 
to extreme value theory, homogenous and non-homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains, random 
walks, probability theory, martingales, Brownian motion, and diffusion processes"
